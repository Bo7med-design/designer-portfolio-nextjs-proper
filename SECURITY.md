## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our portfolio project seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### How to Report

1. **Do NOT create a public GitHub issue** for security vulnerabilities
2. **Email us directly** at: security@ahmed-elbaghdady.com
3. **Include the following information:**
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if you have one)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
- **Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days

### Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue
- We will credit you for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- We ask that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a chance to address it

## Security Measures

### Current Security Practices

1. **Dependency Management**
   - Regular dependency updates
   - Automated vulnerability scanning with `npm audit`
   - Use of only well-maintained, trusted packages

2. **Code Security**
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - ESLint with security rules
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - XSS prevention measures

3. **Build Security**
   - Secure build pipeline
   - Environment variable protection
   - No sensitive data in client-side code

4. **Deployment Security**
   - HTTPS enforcement
   - Security headers implementation
   - Content Security Policy (CSP)
   - Secure cookie settings

### Security Headers

This application implements the following security headers:

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: https:; font-src 'self' data:;
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()
```

## Common Vulnerabilities

### What We Protect Against

1. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
   - Input sanitization
   - Content Security Policy
   - React's built-in XSS protection

2. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
   - SameSite cookie attributes
   - Origin validation

3. **Clickjacking**
   - X-Frame-Options header
   - Frame-ancestors CSP directive

4. **Content Type Sniffing**
   - X-Content-Type-Options header

5. **Dependency Vulnerabilities**
   - Regular security audits
   - Automated dependency updates

### Known Limitations

This is a static portfolio website with the following security considerations:

- No user authentication system
- No sensitive data storage
- No server-side processing of user input
- Limited attack surface due to static nature

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

If you're contributing to this project, please follow these security guidelines:

1. **Dependencies**
   - Only add necessary dependencies
   - Verify package authenticity
   - Keep dependencies updated

2. **Code**
   - Validate all inputs
   - Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` unless absolutely necessary
   - Use TypeScript for type safety
   - Follow secure coding practices

3. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit sensitive data
   - Use `.env.local` for local development
   - Validate environment variables

4. **Third-party Services**
   - Minimize external service dependencies
   - Verify service security practices
   - Use secure communication protocols

## Security Updates

We will announce security updates through:

1. GitHub Security Advisories
2. Release notes in CHANGELOG.md
3. Email notifications to contributors

## Contact

For security-related questions or concerns:

- **Email**: security@ahmed-elbaghdady.com
- **Response Time**: Within 48 hours
- **Encryption**: PGP key available upon request

## Acknowledgments

We appreciate the security research community and will acknowledge researchers who help improve our security posture.
